          <p>Hello! <bold>Iâ€™m Rudra</bold> â€” a passionate and self-motivated Web UI Designer and Full Stack Developer with over 7 years of experience transforming ideas into engaging, pixel-perfect, and responsive user interfaces. I began my journey as a backend .NET developer, but my growing fascination with creative problem-solving and visual storytelling led me to shift into the dynamic world of UI/UX design.

          With a strong eye for detail and a flair for design, I blend technical expertise with artistic sensibility to craft interfaces that are not only functional but delightful to use. Whether itâ€™s building intuitive dashboards, revamping legacy UIs, or converting raw wireframes into production-ready code â€” I bring energy, empathy, and precision to every project.</p>
         <br></br> <p>I work confidently across a modern tech stack that includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
           jQuery, React, Photoshop, .NET Core, Bootstrap, Git, and REST APIs. My design philosophy centers 
           around creating clean, responsive, accessible, and consistent interfaces â€” because I believe great 
           design isnâ€™t just seen, itâ€™s experienced. With every project, my goal is to build something
           meaningful, purposeful, and user-focused.</p>
